       <h2 class="head-styling">Chicken</h2>
       <p class="par-styling">Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the  world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising chickens—in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat and chicken eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisines.Chicken has well-documented health benefits, but different parts and preparation methods factor into how healthy your chicken-based meal turns out. Darker cuts like the thigh and drumstick contain higher caloric content than lighter cuts like the breast. Keeping the skin or frying chicken will also add saturated fat.If you’re switching out red meat for chicken, you’ll want to stick with chicken breast, as it’s the healthiest cut of the bird.Health Benefits
       Chicken makes a fantastic substitute for red meats. A great source of protein, the meat has been linked to a variety of health benefits:Stronger Bones and Muscles The lean protein in chicken is an excellent source of amino acids. Our bodies use amino acids to build muscle tissue, something that is particularly important as we age. Studies have also shown that higher protein intake helps to maintain bone mineral density. Eating chicken can help to build stronger muscles and promote healthier bones, decreasing the risk of injuries and diseases such as osteoporosis.Weight Management and Heart Health Research suggests that 25-30 grams of protein per meal can help us feel more full. Protein rich meals can make us feel fuller despite us eating less, which helps to promote better weight management. Healthier weight leads to improvements in risk factors for heart problems such as high triglyceride levels and high blood pressure. A food rich in protein, chicken can help with weight management and reduce the risk of heart disease.</p>

       <h2 class="head-styling">Sushi</h2>
       <p class="par-styling">The fish in sushi is the number one brain food! The essential fats, or Omega 3 fatty acids, nourish and repair brain cells. As fish is also rich in protein and essential fats, it helps focus the mind, increase concentration and maintain energy, making sushi a perfect lunchtime option during your working day.Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian.Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice.
